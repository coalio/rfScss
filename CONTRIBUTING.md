# Contributing to rfscss

Hey! Glad you decided to contribute to this project.

I'll guide you personally through the process of contributing to the project. First of all, there is several ways of contributing.

The first one would be to fork the project and make your own improvements. If you are familiar with GitHub, you can do this by simply clicking on the "Fork" button. It can be something as simple as adding new test cases or even improvements such as adding a new feature.

You can also test rfscss and <a href="https://github.com/coalio/rfscss/issues/new/choose">open an issue</a> on GitHub if you think something can be improved. Even better, you can also implement your suggestion and make a pull request.

Sharing the project is also a way of contributing! If you think someone would be helped by this tool, sharing the knowledge would be amazing.

## Guidelines

Anything is fine as long as the code is clean, C++'ish and well documented. Don't hesitate of leaving comments if you think something looks tricky. 

Your pull request will be discussed upon and if everything it's fine, it will be merged into the develop branch, as the master branch is reserved for releases.
